"""
File to test the Environment class of environment_interface.py.
Has following functions:
* demonstrate_random_agent() shows how an random agent interacts with the
    environment and prints the oberservations, rewards, etc.
* show_rgb_observation() shows an observation RGB array as returned by the 
    Environment as an image. (used to confirm that the observations are 
    as expected.)
